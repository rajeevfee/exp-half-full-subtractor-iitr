#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  :    <u> Expositry
###### Assessment Method: Formative Assessment

<u> <b>Description: </b> Instructional Strategy will be implemented in the simulator as follows: </u>
<br>
 This Experiment Contains two Sections one for 1 bit comparator and another for 2 bit comparator. Each section gives freedom to user to change binary i/p according to him and also to predict the output based on his previous knowledge.

Read the theory and comprehend the concepts related to the experiment. [LO1, LO2, LO3]
<br>

Sr. No |	Learning Objective	| Task to be performed by <br> the student  in the simulator | Assessment Questions as per LO & Task
:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.| Student will be able to identify the circuit of Half/Full Subtractor. <br>  | Choose the Subtractor and then click on Circuit button. <br>  |Q1.How many outputs are required for the implementation of a subtractor?  <br>A. 1<br> <b>B. 2</b><br> C. 3<br> D. 4<br>  Q2. The full subtractor can be implemented using<br>A. Two XOR and an OR gates<br><b> B. Two half subtractors and an OR gate</b><br> C.Two multiplexers and an AND gate<br>D. None of the Mentioned <br> 
2.| Student will be able to Use the Simulator to examine your knowledge about Half/Full Subtractor | Enter binary i/p and corresponding o/p based on your knowledge about Subtractors and click on “Check” to check your answer.<br> | Q1. Half subtractor have an output to specify that 1 has been? <br> A. Complemented. <br><b>B. Borrowed. </b><br> C. Carried. <br> D.Primed. <br>2. Full subtractor is used to perform subtraction of? <br> A. 2 Bits <br> <b>B. 3 Bits </b><br> C. 4 Bits <br> D. 8 Bits  <br> 
3.|Student will be able to analyze truth table and verify based on theory studied in theory section. | Observe the Remarks in table and analyze it based on Theory in theory section.<br> | Q1.Result of two bit subtraction is called? <br><b>a) difference bit.</b> <br>b) least significant bit. <br>c) most significant bit <br>d) carry bit <br> Q2.Simplified expression of half subtractor borrow is: <br>a) B0=A+B <br>b) B0=AB <br><b>c) B0=A’B </b><br>d) B0=AB’<br>

#### 4. Simulator Interactions:
<br>

Sr.No | What Students will do? |	What Simulator will do?	| Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:--:
1.| Choose a subtractor. <br> | Display the simulator window for particular simulator.<br> |To perform experiment on a particular subtractor. 
2.| Enter the Binary inputs and corresponding outputs according to his Knowledge and then click on Check.| <br>Input and Output will be added to input with corresponding remarks.<br> | To check the knowledge of operration of subtractor.
3.| Click on “Circuit” Button. <br>|Display Circuit corresponding to the particular subtractor.<br> | To verify truth table with the help of circuit diagram.
4.| Click on “Reset” button<br>| Clear all the input and Output Fields.<br> |To provide space for further entries.
